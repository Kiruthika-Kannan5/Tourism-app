    Tourism is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining
    tourists, and the business of operating tours.[2] The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the 
    common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual 
    environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposesTourism can be domestic
    (within the traveller's own country) or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's 
    balance of payments.Tourism numbers declined as a result of a strong economic slowdown (the late-2000s recession) between the second half of 2008 
    2009, and in consequence of the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus,[4][5] but slowly recovered. Globally, international tourism receipts
    grew to US$1.03 trillion (â‚¬740 billion) in 2005, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 3.8% from 2010
